            <h3>Web Developer and Web Designer</h3>
            <p>Hi there, I'm Luke Rebeiro, a self-taught web developer and UI/UX designer hailing from the United
                Kingdom. My passion lies in crafting and designing visually appealing websites, using a range of
                computer design software, including Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and XD. Prior to writing the
                code for my websites, I utilize these programs to create their design. I thoroughly enjoy the challenge
                of developing intricate and imaginative code, and always aim to deliver effective and polished web
                designs using HTML (HTML5), CSS (CSS3), and Javascript (ES6 and various frameworks like React). Over the
                course of three years, I have designed and coded various webpages and pursued multiple courses to
                enhance my expertise as a developer.</p>

            <h3>Web Developer and Web Designer</h3>
            <p>
                As a self-taught web developer and UI/UX designer, I have had the opportunity to explore my creativity
                and build websites that not only look visually stunning but also offer seamless user experience. I am
                always eager to explore new design trends and techniques and incorporate them into my projects to ensure
                that they remain up-to-date and relevant in today's fast-paced digital world.

                One of the most important aspects of website design is understanding the user's needs and preferences.
                This is where my knowledge of UI/UX design comes in handy. I strive to create intuitive and easy-to-use
                interfaces that guide the user through the website and keep them engaged. I believe that a website's
                success is directly linked to its ability to keep the user interested and engaged, and I always keep
                this in mind when designing and developing a new site.

                Before I begin writing the code for a new website, I spend a considerable amount of time brainstorming
                and sketching out the design. I often start with a pen and paper, creating rough sketches of the layout,
                color schemes, and other design elements. Once I have a general idea of the design, I move onto the
                computer design software, where I create detailed mockups of the website using programs such as Adobe
                Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and XD.

                Once the design is finalized, I move onto the development phase, where I use HTML (HTML5), CSS (CSS3),
                and Javascript (ES6 and various frameworks like React) to turn the design into a fully functional
                website. Writing code is both challenging and rewarding, and I always strive to create elegant and
                efficient code that is easy to read and maintain.

                Over the course of three years, I have designed and coded numerous webpages for various clients and
                personal projects. I have also pursued multiple courses and attended workshops to expand my knowledge
                and stay up-to-date with the latest web design and development trends. As a result, I am confident in my
                ability to tackle any design or development project and deliver exceptional results
